# AI Mock Interview Practice Platform (Data Science)

 **Project in Progress** 

This platform is designed to provide **AI-powered mock interviews for Data Science**. It will generate **dynamic, domain-specific questions**, evaluate responses across **SQL, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning**, and provide **instant feedback** to help learners prepare for real-world technical interviews.  

---

##  Overview
- **Dynamic Question Generation** â†’ NLP & LLMs for topic-specific and adaptive difficulty.  
- **Automated Evaluation** â†’ SQL execution, Python code checks, and theory assessment via AI.  
- **Instant Feedback** â†’ Explanations, hints, and analytics for improvement.  
- **Cloud-Native Design** â†’ Built with scalable data pipelines and deployable with Docker/CI/CD.

##  Planned Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **AI / ML:** NLP, LLMs, Generative AI, LangChain  
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask  
- **Database:** Postgres / SQLite  
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, Cloud Pipelines
